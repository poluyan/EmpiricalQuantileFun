Multivariate empirical continuous quantile function (grid-based). There are two approaches to quantile function evaluation depending on the type of sample storage. In the first case, the sample is presented in the explicit (real-valued) form and stored in the matrix. In the second case, the sample is presented in the implicit form and the trie-based structure. Here presented header-only library that allows you to perform quantile transforms based on given sample points. For more info and examples see: [poluyan.github.io/mveqf](https://poluyan.github.io/mveqf/)

### Requirements

To compile from source, you need C++ 17 compiler and CMake for building examples.

### Installing

To use this library and perform quantile tranforms only header files from `mveqf` are needed. 

##### Linux (gcc/clang)

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/poluyan/mveqf
$ cd mveqf
$ cmake .
$ make
```

##### Windows (Visual Studio 2019+ with MSVC)

Clone the entire repository and build it locally. 

### Examples

Some examples of using `mveqf` to perform quantile transform presented in `demos` directory. Follow these steps to build and run the examples. After these steps all the binaries should be generated and presented in the `bin` directory.

```cpp
#include <mveqf/implicit.h>
int main()
{
	using gt = std::uint8_t; // integer type to store grid node components: char, unsigned char, int, ...

	std::size_t d = 2; // dimension
	std::vector<std::size_t> grid = {9, 10}; // regular grid sizes

	// data structure for sample storage - modified Trie with NodeCount nodes
	using sample_type = mveqf::TrieBased<mveqf::NodeCount<gt>, gt>;

	// pointer to the sample which will be moved to quantile object
	std::shared_ptr<sample_type> sample = std::make_shared<sample_type>();
	sample->set_dimension(d); // setting dimension

	sample->insert(std::vector<gt>{2, 6}); // adding grid node to sample
	sample->insert(std::vector<gt>{5, 7}); // first component from [0;8] range, second from [0;9]

	std::vector<float> lb(d, -3.0f); // lower bound for each component
	std::vector<float> ub(d, 3.0f); // upper bound for each component

	mveqf::ImplicitQuantile<gt, float> mveqfunc(lb, ub, grid); // object to perform quantile transofrm
	mveqfunc.set_sample_shared_and_fill_count(sample); // moving sample to quantile object

	std::vector<float> values01 = {0.427f, 0.791f}; // values to transform
	std::vector<float> sampled(d); // vector to store values after transform

	mveqfunc.transform(values01, sampled); // performing transform and saving values to sampled
}
```
