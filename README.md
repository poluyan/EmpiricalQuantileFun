# EmpiricalQuantileFun

Multivariate empirical grid-based continuous quantile function. There are two approaches to quantile function evaluation depending on the type of sample storage. In the first case, the sample is presented in the explicit (real-valued) form and stored in the matrix. In the second case, the sample is presented in the implicit form and the trie-based structure.
